# IST 707 Data Analytics Portfolio Deliverables

## What is in this folder
- The course syllabus (for convenience)
- A folder containing the project files and data source.

## What is not in this folder
- The raw data. I want to limit how much I upload to GitHub, so the data will have to be downloaded from the data source in `data-source-info.md`.

## How to execute the scripts in this folder

A Python environment with the following packages accessible:
- nltk
